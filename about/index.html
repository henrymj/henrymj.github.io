<div class="blurb">
	<p> I was born in a year with many elections and natural disasters </p>
  <p> I have been (interested) in school, education and academia for as long as I can remember </p>
  <p> I am tall, but not, like, <em> crazy </em> tall </p>
  <p> I like thinking about new ways to analyze the brain and behavior, and what sort of questions they let us ask </p>
  <p> I enjoy breathing in nature, listening to jams, and staring at things </p>
  <p> I am currently employed at the <a href="https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/"> Poldrack Lab </a>, but you probably knew that already
  <p> If you like things, please let me know about them
